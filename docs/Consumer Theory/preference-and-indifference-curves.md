## Consumer Theory

**Consumer Theory** is the study of how and why consumers behave as they do.

**Goods** are items that consumers purchase.

* A **bundle of goods**, or **basket**, is a list of goods
* **Non-Negativity Constraint**: Agents only consume positive, real amounts of any good.

## Preferences

Consumer preferences are said to be **rational** if they are **complete** and **transitive**.

* **Completeness**: the consumer is always able to choose between alternatives
* **Transitivity**: choices are logically consistent

!!! info "Transitivity"
    A preference is  **transitive** when, for any three bundles $A$, $B$, and $C$, the following is true: 
    If $A \ge B$ and $B \ge C$, then $A \ge C$

Consumer preferences can also be **continuous**, which implies that bundles with similar quantities will be similary valued.

!!! info "Continuity" 
    A preference is said to be **continuous**  when, for any two bundles $A$ and $B$, such that $A \ge B$ for the consumer, there exists a region "close to" $A$ for which all bundles will be better than $B$.

## Utility Functions

If a consumer has preferences that are **complete**, **transitive** and **continuous**, then there exists at least one **continuous** utility function that represents those preferences.

Utility is **ordinal**, meaning that the utility level of a particular bundle is only relevant in comparison with the utility levels of other bundles.

Consequently, it is not meaningful to compare across different consumers:

* Utility values
* The "magnitude" of utility change between allocations

!!! example 
    $u(A) = 6 \gt u(B) = 5$ has the same economic meaning as $u(A) = 10 \gt u(B) = 1$

This means that any transformation of a utility function that preserves the preference order is itself a utility function for the same preference relation.

!!! example
    If $u$ is a utility function, then $u + 1$ is also a utility function for the same preference relation.
